Collection of projects I have worked on over the course of the past few years. Each folder/project contains its own document to describe its purpose. A breif description is below:

1. **_Carnegie Mellon University: Human Computer Interaction Institute -- Research Experience for Undergraduates_** (CMU_HCII_REU)
   - **Exercise Classifier** 
     - Using data collected by the *Microsoft Kinect V2* depth camera, we trained multiple fully connected neural networks to classify a set of 10 full body stretches. Incorporating a frame by frame and video analysis approach, we examined the benefits of both approaches and the potential uses of a dual stream model.
     - Accomplished through the use of the *Kinect* and *Tensorflow* APIs

2. **ParticleGravitySim**
   - Reads data from a text file to construct a physics simulation of massive numbers of particles. Able to approximate the collision of two      galaxies. Uses the Barnes-Hut Algorithm for the optimization of the n-body simulation
   
3. **Adventure** 
   - Creates a text based adventure for the user to explore and solve puzzles within. First CS project I ever attempted, emphasized use of
   conditional statements and basic variable manipulation
